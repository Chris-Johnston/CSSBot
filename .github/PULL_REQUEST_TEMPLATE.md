Hi!

It looks like you are submitting a new pull request.

Please ensure that you've checked in all the files that you need for your project to build.
If your project doesn't build, it will be caught in AppVeyor, and will not be merged.

Make sure that your project works in runtime (AppVeyor doesn't check that). Be sure to include 
any details that may affect how the changes will affect runtime (new args to command line, etc).
Including examples and screenshots are nice!

Keep in mind that all changes and PRs will have to go through the contributors first before being added.
It is completely up to our discretion what we add and what we don't add.
